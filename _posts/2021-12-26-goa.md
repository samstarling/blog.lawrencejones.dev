One year ago I was working at GoCardless, building a prototype of an [Open
Banking product][gocardless/ibp].

As this was the first product work I'd done in a while (that wasn't a Kubernetes
operator or database tool) it felt sensible to revisit the API development
scene, not wanting to do things as I always had if there were better options out
there.

[goa]: https://goa.design/

My hunch was right- the API scene _had_ moved on. After looking at a variety of
tools, we adopted a tool called [Goa][goa], helping us build an API at a level
of polish that shocked me.

For almost no added effort, Goa helped:

- Rapidly iterate on the API design
- Generate type-safe server implementations, guaranteed to be consistent with
  the API spec
- Produce transport specifications like OpenAPI specs
- ...from which we could generate typed API clients and documentation

[incident.io]: https://incident.io/

One year later and I'm now working at [incident.io][incident.io], where one of
my first contributions was to use Goa to power our API. It's proved to be
extremely valuable, especially in a start-up that wants to move fast while _not_
breaking things.

This post explains how the toolchain works, and everything you get for free when
you adopt it.

# API design

So you have a product idea, and it needs an API.

Everything with Goa starts with the 'design', where you use the Goa DSL to
specify services and methods, and the types they use.

Borrowing from my work at incident.io, let's say we want an API to create an
incident. Here's what that might look like:

```go
package design

import (
  . "goa.design/goa/v3/dsl"
)

var Incident = Type("Incident", func() {
  Attribute("id", String, "Unique identifier for the incident", func() {
    Example("01FDAG4SAP5TYPT98WGR2N7W91")
  })
  Attribute("name", String, "Name of the incident", func() {
    Example("Full service outage")
  })
  Required(
    "id",
    "name",
  )
})

var _ = Service("Incidents", func() {
  Description("Manage incidents")

  HTTP(func() {
    Path("/api/incidents")
  })

  Method("Create", func() {
    Description("Create a new incident")

    Payload(func() {
      Reference(Incident)
      Attribute("name")
    })

    Result(Incident)

    HTTP(func() {
      POST("/")
    })
  })
})
```

In this example, we define an `Incident` type and an `Incidents` service, with a
`Create` method that accepts an incident name and returns an `Incident`. All of
those definitions are abstracted from the transport, with `HTTP` blocks binding
the application concepts to HTTP calls.

While this example includes HTTP bindings, you can easily include gRPC bindings,
if that's how you prefer to serve your API. It's one of Goa's strengths that the
authors really understand APIs, and have created solid abstractions for each of
the supported transports that rarely leak.

Returning to our example: right now all we have a design, but no implementation.
We'll use Goa to codegen the rest:

```console
$ goa gen github.com/lawrencejones/goa-example/api/design -o api
api/gen/http/incidents/server/encode_decode.go
api/gen/http/incidents/server/paths.go
api/gen/http/incidents/server/server.go
api/gen/http/incidents/server/types.go
api/gen/http/openapi.json
api/gen/incidents/client.go
api/gen/incidents/endpoints.go
api/gen/incidents/service.go
```

Let's break this down:

- `api/gen/incidents` contains the application level interfaces for the
  incidents service, everything that is separate from the transport. We'll
  implement these interfaces when we're building our service.
- `api/gen/http/incidents` binds HTTP level concepts (HTTP requests, HTTP
  response types) to the transport-agnostic service interfaces.
  `encode_decode.go` is about going from XML/JSON/etc to Go-native types, so
  developers can avoid transport concerns.
- `api/gen/http/openapi.json` is an OpenAPI specification for the API.

The application interface Goa generates should be unsurprising:

```go
package incidents

type Service interface {
  // Create a new incident
  Create(context.Context, *CreatePayload) (res *Incident, err error)
}

// Incident is the result type of the Incidents service Create method.
type Incident struct {
  // Unique identifier for the incident
  ID string
  // Name of the incident
  Name string
}
```

All that remains to be done, as a developer implementing this API design, is to
write an implementation that satisfies this interface.

That looks like this:

```go
package api

import (
  "context"
  "github.com/lawrencejones/goa-example/api/gen/incidents"
  "github.com/google/uuid"
)

func NewIncidents() incidents.Service {
  return &incidentsService{}
}

type incidentsService struct {
}

func (svc *incidentsService) Create(ctx context.Context, payload *incidents.CreatePayload) (*incidents.Incident, error) {
  inc := incidents.Incident{
    ID:   uuid.NewString(),
    Name: payload.Name,
  }

  return &inc, nil
}
```

Once you get used to this pattern–design, generate, implement–it becomes really
easy to incrementally build your API. The flow emphasises the most important
part of building any API, which is the design, and implementation is simplified
as fixing the compiler errors (`*incidentsService does not implement
incidents.Service (missing Create method)`).

That's the hard part done- from here out, everything is easy.

# Generate a client

Having used the API design to generate backend types, which the compiler will
guarantee our implementation is consistent with, you can have total faith in the
generated API specifications being correct and up-to-date.

Now we have faithful specifications, such as the OpenAPI spec, we can use them
to generate API clients. Most projects I've worked with have a frontend
component in TypeScript which can benefit from a strongly typed client
guaranteed to be consistent with the server implementation.

[github/openapi-generator]: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator
[github/typescript-fetch]: https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/blob/master/docs/generators/typescript-fetch.md

[OpenAPI Generator][github/openapi-generator] can help you here. It ships with a
number of generators that use an OpenAPI specification to build clients in
various flavours (language, frameworks, etc).

Picking the right generator is key, as quality can be inconsistent. We've had
success with [typescript-fetch][github/typescript-fetch], a vanilla TypeScript
client that works best with the legacy `openapi.yml` that Goa produces:

```
$ make clients/typescript
java -jar openapi-generator-cli.jar \
    generate \
        --generator-name typescript-fetch \
        --input-spec api/gen/http/openapi.json \
        --skip-validate-spec \
        --additional-properties npmName=goa-example,typescriptThreePlus=true,modelPropertyNaming=original \
        --output clients/typescript

[main] INFO  o.o.codegen.DefaultGenerator - Generating with dryRun=false
[main] INFO  o.o.codegen.DefaultGenerator - OpenAPI Generator: typescript-fetch (client)
[main] INFO  o.o.codegen.DefaultGenerator - Generator 'typescript-fetch' is considered stable.
[main] INFO  o.o.codegen.TemplateManager - writing file /Users/lawrence/Projects/goa-example/clients/typescript/src/models/IncidentsCreateRequestBody.ts
...
```

Now you have an API client, giving integrators an ideal experience in their
language of choice:

```typescript
import { IncidentsApi, Configuration } from "clients/typescript";

const client = IncidentsApi(new Configuration());
const incident = await client
  .incidentsCreate({
    createRequestBody: {
      name: "Full service outage",
    },
  });

alert("Created incident with ID=${incident.id}");
```

TypeScript is just one of hundreds of generators- see the full list
[here][openapi/generators].

# Frontend benefits

At incident.io we have a monorepo with both the frontend web application
(`client`) and backend implementation (`server`), with the backend using Goa to
expose an API for the frontend to consume.

[react-hook-form]: https://react-hook-form.com/

Introducing Goa has been great for many reasons, but Goa + TypeScript clients
really shine when building frontend forms. We use [react-hook-form][react-hook-form]
for frontend form components, which has TypeScript bindings so you can
strongly-type your form fields.

Now we have a TypeScript client, we can parameterise react-hook-forms with
client types, allowing the TypeScript compiler to tell us when our form
definitions are mismatched with our API definition:

```tsx
import { useClient } from "contexts/ClientContext";
import { IncidentsCreateRequestBody } from "clients/typescript";

const IncidentCreateForm = ({
  closeCallback,
}: {
  closeCallback: () => void;
}): React.ReactElement | null => {
  const client = useClient();

  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm<IncidentsCreateRequestBody>();

  const onSubmit = (body: IncidentsCreateRequestBody) => {
    client
      .incidentsCreate({createRequestBody: body})
      .then(() => {
        closeCallback();
      });
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
      <input {...register("name")} />
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  );
}
```

Before this, building forms that use an API would require care to produce
requests consistent with the backend. Making changes to that API would require
manual review of frontend code to find all uses of the API, hoping you catch
them all before deploying.

In a world with Goa and generated clients, you:

1. Adjust the Goa design
1. Generate backend types and frontend client (`make api/gen clients/typescript`)
1. Fix backend compiler errors
1. Fix frontend compiler errors

If we changed the incident `name` field to be `description`, we'll get a
compiler error about our form immediately:

```
IncidentCreateForm.tsx:21:20 - error TS2322:
        Type '"name"' is not assignable to type '"description" | "severity_id"'.

21      register("name")
         ~~
```

I can't overstate how useful this is, especially for maximising developer
productivity and confidence in changes.

# More than this

In projects where updating the specification (OpenAPI, etc) is optional in any
sense, it will inevitably drift out-of-sync with reality.

At it's heart, this toolchain is so valuable because you can trust the API
specifications are accurate. That guarantee means a whole ecosystem of tools
surrounding OpenAPI become even more compelling.

[github/go-swagger]: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger

As just one example, [go-swagger][github/go-swagger] can generate documentation
for OpenAPI specifications that are really high quality.

Most of my Goa projects have a `make docs` target:

```console
$ make docs
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -p 4000:4000 --rm -v "$(pwd)/api:/api" -it quay.io/goswagger/swagger:v0.28.0 \
                serve --no-open --port=4000 --host=0.0.0.0 /api/gen/http/openapi.json
2022/01/22 17:57:24 serving docs at http://localhost:4000/docs
```

Which is all you need to get docs worthy of a paid-for product:

# It all feels too easy

[json-hyperschema]: https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/json-schema-hypermedia.html

When I first joined GoCardless in 2015, we had just built crank, an in-house
tool for generating API client libraries from [JSON hyperschema][json-hyperschema].

As a company who (at the time) thought of their product as the API, this was a
no-brainer. Crank helped us maintain a suite of client libraries across several
languages and automatically generated our docs, often the source of compliments
and product referrals.

Maintaining crank was not fun, though. By the time I left in 2021, crank was
still building our client libraries and docs, despite it being the tool everyone
loved to hate.

With that in mind, finding a toolchain that takes a couple of days to setup
and gives an amazing development experience feels like a cheat. Our internal
APIs have documentation that rivals API products, something I will never fail to
marvel at.

Adopting these tools at incident.io is one of the main reasons we can move so
fast, and make product changes with such confidence. Whatever language you use,
find a similar toolchain and try it out- I can recommend it with no caveats!
