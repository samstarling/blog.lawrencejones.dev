For the last three months we've been building the incident.io Catalog: read the

One of the things I enjoy about working at incident is we often build products
I've been thinking about or actively using for years. The catalog may be the
best example of this, having spent years at GoCardless building and looking
after our homegrown service registry, and talking publicly about [why everyone
needs one][registry].

That said, when I was first asked to look into what a catalog would mean for
incident, it felt more stressful than exciting. I've spoken with loads of
companies over the years who have tried implementing a catalog, and it doesn't
make for pretty reading. Many invest heavily only to end up with a token
'catalog' that's mostly vanity, unused by much of the organisation but too
embarrassing to now remove.

I was sincerely worried we might build a product of similar anti-value.

Thankfully with what we released today, I can confidently say we haven't. The
catalog we've built is woven into our incident product and having dogfooded it
ourselves, totally changed our incident response.

There are several decisions we made that lead to this.

## Know why we were building a catalog

Our competitors have a catalog already, and we'd often receive requests to build
one. But having a catalog is not the end goal, and just 'building one' is likely
to result in a product that looks pretty and doesn't help anyone.

Early on, the framing was "if we know about your organisation, we can better
help you respond to incidents".

One example would be "who should I page if this feature is broken?". This is a
common problem customers experienced, and were solving by creating workflows
like "when feature is Payment Gateway escalate to Payments team".

That sucks, because now you have hundreds of workflows for each team. Not
manageable, not understandable, and boring to configure. Additionally, if we
know about your organisation ‚Äì such as what product features you manage, and who
owns said features ‚Äì we should be able to build a general "Escalate" workflow
that can figure out who to page from whichever features are impacted.

Supercharging your incident response by better understanding your organisation,
where that understanding comes from the data you push into the catalog, was our
goal.

## Bring your schema

So we need to model organisation data in our system. But what model should we
use?

To decide, we need to understand how people normally store their data. Our
customers generally split into:

1. They **have nothing**: usually a spreadsheet or a document detailing teams and
   ownership, nothing complex but they often want something more sophisticated.
2. There's a **homegrown catalog** (like the one I've written about at GoCardless)
   that has already received substantial investment and the organisation is
   tightly coupled to.
3. Using an **existing catalog** like OpsLevel, Cortex or Backstage. Adoption of
   these tools is highly variable, ranging from "I think we have it?" to
   "company-wide mandate that everything goes into Backstage".

So, like, no consistency. Not even at all.

But that's ok, because one of my core beliefs about service catalogs is that
there is no one-size-fits-all structure that works for everyone. The companies
I've seen have great success adopting catalogs are often those that support very
flexible structures, allowing them to easily model their organisation's
weirdness and ease adopting manual existing processes into their catalog.

In contrast, I've seen many people stumble trying to adjust their view of the
world to the Backstage systems model. Sometimes enough that they give up.

The conclusion is we need to be extremely flexible and allow people to bring
their schema, rather than asking them to adhere to one we provide. And if we do
this, we should be able to load data from wherever they currently have it,
rather than having to ask people to both change an existing process as well as
how they run it (e.g. moving from a spreadsheet to our catalog) at the same
time.

Happy days, though obviously what we're describing is much more like a general
database, foreign keys and column types included. Much more ambitious than a
naive, opinionated catalog, but worth it if we have conviction in our reasoning.

## Gradual adoption, positive feedback loops

The truth is that building a catalog is hard. If you want to list all services
and who owns them, you probably need to actually solve ownership (yuck), and any
similar problems are going to be a cross-team effort.

People who already have a catalog are tired. They're sick of fighting people to
update this stuff or having discussions about why it's important. The last thing
they want is another big lift-and-shift.

That's why even though we know the rest of the product ‚Äì such as Workflows ‚Äì can
do amazing things once you get the catalog loaded, we wanted to find an adoption
carrot that required zero-effort from customers and was attractive to almost any
customer we spoke to.

This carrot became "load your catalog data, then you can power custom fields
from the catalog".

Almost all our customers have a field like "Affected services" where they've
been maintaining a list of service options. Anyone with a catalog is duplicating
their service list into incident, and paying the cost of keeping things
up-to-date. Let's remove that friction by powering field options directly from
their catalog, making everyone's lives easier.

That's a really feel-good first step, and easily moves to a second: now custom
fields are powered by the catalog, you can create other fields such as "Affected
team" and say "set this field to be all the teams who own any of the Affected
services". The catalog knows who owns what, so we can stop asking people to
manually fill out teams.

Making it possible to gradually adopt the catalog and immediately get value is a
fundamental part of our adoption strategy. Then there's the positive feedback
loop when people begin using existing catalog data inside of incident: it's
added incentive for people to invest in the existing catalog, which helps the
teams who manage them.

## Increasingly powerful as you invest

Finally, we've built on the engine described in [Building Workflows](/workflows)
that is at the core of our product so that catalog data is available everywhere.

That meant implementing a query language that could explore catalog data, with
operations such as:

- Navigate: e.g. for each Affected team, find the Owner (builds a list of Teams)
- Filter: e.g. build a list of any Teams which are in X business unit
- Count: e.g. calculate total Affected teams

Anywhere in the app you could use expressions ‚Äì Workflows, or incident Triggers
where you can create incidents from external alerts, and more ‚Äì are immediately
catalog 'aware', which allows you to use your organisation map across any of
your incident response config.

Chris (our CPO) has been going wild building out increasingly cool flows for our
account. We now have workflows that notify Customer Success Managers if anyone
mentions a customer they manage inside of an incident, and a much improved
escalation flow for people across the business to raise incidents and know the
right team gets paged.

This stuff has almost unlimited potential and it's going to take a while for
people to figure it out. But it's already blowing people's minds, which is
really awesome.

## So not too bad.

I really did begin this project feeling very nervous. As I said to start, I'd
personally witnessed thousands of hours invested in building catalogs that
delivered very little value, and I had no wish for us to create yet another
time-sink tool.

But with a focus on enabling genuinely useful flows within the context of
incident response, and an appreciation for delivering value for each incremental
investment people made into our catalog, we've built a product that I think is
really awesome.

That said, it's been a grind. And taken much longer than most projects.

It's involved:

- Building [terraform-provider-incident](https://github.com/incident-io/terraform-provider-incident) specifically so people could manage catalog entries from terraform.
- Creation of the [catalog-importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) as a 'universal adapter' to pull catalog data from any source, be it API, code, Backstage or otherwise.
- Creating integrations for OpsLevel, Cortex and Backstage.

And so much more, including some really complex work supporting for loops in
workflows and building out the catalog expression builder.

Having initially felt stressful, I'm super proud of the team for delivering what
I believe is the most powerful catalog out of any incident tool you can find on
the market.

I even hear Leo may have printed us physical catalog books with a copy of our
own homegrown catalog in it. So I guess even if the product falls flat, we'll
have a souvenir to remember the work by!

far.
