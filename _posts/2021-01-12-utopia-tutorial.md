excerpt: |
  <p>
    Building a modern infrastructure stack is difficult, with a bewildering
    number of choices to be made. Some technologies complement each other, while
    others have very different philosophies: it’s easy to get lost.
  </p>
  <p>
    To help those facing similar challenges, we’re open-sourcing our “Getting
    Started” tutorial, which is what we ask all GoCardless developers to follow
    during their onboarding.
